Why agile is fit for government
===============================

Because when you focus on operational softwares rather than comprehensive documentation, you have more chances to have an irritating procedure resolved than a simple plan.
Because when you focus on the adaptation to change more than on following a plan, you have more chances to have an irritating procedure resolved than a nice idea that failed. Because when you focus on the individuals and their interactions more than on processes and tools, you have more chances to have an irritating procedure resolved than a toolbox. Because when you focus on collaboration more than on contractual negotiation, you have more chances to have an irritating procedure resolved than a steering committee.
